Bonus Features Implemented
--------------------------

1) Textual record of players plays
   -> Every move is documented in a scrolling textView on the rights side
      of the window
   -> At the end of every round & the end of the game, a summary of the 
      discards & scores is appended to the textView
   -> Gives great oversight of game progress

2) Providing visual queues for which cards are legal plays
   -> Only the cards that are legal plays are selectable, and there is a
      clear indication of the currently selected card by the card's border
   -> Provides good visual queues to the user and facilitates gameplay

3) All moves made by ComputerPlayers are not instant to give good overview
   of the moves being made.
   -> The UI smoothly runs through computer-played moves rather than running
      them all at once
