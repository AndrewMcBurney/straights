# straights
:spades: A card game made with Mart van Buren. Made with C++11, gtkmm, and glade.

This card game was developed as part of a university project where we had to implement the game using a number of design patterns and best practices.

We implemented our game using the MVC, Strategy, and Facade design patterns and created a GUI with gtkmm and glade.

Our final grade for the project was 108.4%, since we implemented bonus features and received perfect on the project.
